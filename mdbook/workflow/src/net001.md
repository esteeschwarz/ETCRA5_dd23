# networks visualisation of literary texts
- [GEPHI][1]
- [cytoscape][2]
much of information about literary network analyses you find here: [https://fortext.net/tags/netzwerk][3].   
i try to get you a bit into using GEPHI with the network data supplied by dracor and that e.g. is created in the process of a stylometric analysis.
