# texteditors
for the transcription and processing of your vorlage you better work with  a texteditor which extend the capacities of notepad or in general IS NOT a WYSIWYG editor to be able to edit plain text.
a choice of editors:
- [ATOM][1] seems to be deprecated
- [SUBLIME][2]
- [VS Code][3] I would recommend this one

both feature a regex implementation which you will need for further processing of the text.
