# TEI preprocessing
1. to enable later TEI refactoring apply a simple markup to the text explained [here][1]. that will ease the process of the complex TEI markup.
2. then open the jupyter-notebook (a small python script) in the runtime environment at: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/dracor-org/ezdrama/blob/main/ezdramaparser.ipynb][2]
3. there you upload your prepared textfile with the markup as explained above.
4. rename it to: `sample.txt`, this will ease the process
5. execute the script with *Laufzeit \> alle ausf√ºhren*
6. now there should be a `sample_indented.xml` file in your files, which you can download and rename; it contains the final TEI version ready for DRACOR after a few minor adaptations.
