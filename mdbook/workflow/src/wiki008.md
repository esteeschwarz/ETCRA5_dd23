# wikisource editing
- upload (copy/paste in text) each transcribed page to wikisource for having it proofread there. it would be nice if participants proofread the texts of each other vcvs.
- observe transcription rules
	- preserve the original orthography of the vorlage. don't adapt the spelling to modern orthography
	- markup speakers and stage directions with '''3 apostrophes''', (bold) and ''2 apostrophes'' (italic)
- if you have proofread transcriptions, turn the status to yellow resp. green for 1x/2x proofread.
