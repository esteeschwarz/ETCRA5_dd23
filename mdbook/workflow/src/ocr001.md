# transkribus workflow
a good model for german fraktur typography is "ONB\_Newseye\_GT\_M1+".\_  
you first have to import your pages. you create a collection and upload files to it.  
then you open \<text recognition\> and choose a model:

you can either correct mistakes within the transkribus frontend itself or download the transcription first and then edit the page in the wikisource editor.  
if you want to have more configurations options you can try the TRANSKRIBUS expert client. it requires java (the JDK) on your OS and runs locally on your desktop but requires an internet connection to the transkribus server.

from here you can edit your transcription and export it to a textfile. it seems editing only works in a desktop browser, not mobile; for that reason and also for better layout analysis options its still recommended to use the expert client. transkribus will soon  deprecate that for a new client web app so its maybe a good idea to download the old expert client as long as its availabe.
