# transkribus workflow
a good model for german fraktur typography is "ONB\_Newseye\_GT\_M1+".\_  
you first have to import your pages. you create a collection and upload files to it.  
then you open \<text recognition\> and choose a model:

you can either correct mistakes within the transkribus frontend itself or download the transcription first and then edit the page in the wikisource editor.   
if you want to have more configurations options you can try the TRANSKRIBUS expert client. it requires java (the JDK) on your OS and runs locally on your desktop but requires an internet connection to the transkribus server.
