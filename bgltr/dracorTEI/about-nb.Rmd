# replacements
you can upload a table (.csv) with replacements to apply to your transcript. the table has to be in the following format:

```{}
,find,replace
samplefind1,dummyreplace1
samplefind2,dummyreplace2
findthis(captured),thisis\1
\nan a at the beginning,\nbegins with b now

```

please mind that this 1st stage replacements are applied to the text as single character string, which means if you want to adress characters dependent on line beginnings or endings you have to adress these with `\n` in the table, and NOT with `^` or `$` like as for single line find/replacements. the rest is still pure regular expressions and capture groups are adressed as e.g. `\1` for capture group 1.
